# Container Images

Reelay provides containerized environments for both development and running applications. The repository includes Dockerfiles for two main use cases: development containers and application containers.

## Prerequisites

Before using Reelay containers, you need either:

- **Docker**: Install from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Podman**: A daemonless alternative to Docker

## Development Container

The development container provides a complete environment for building and testing Reelay with all required dependencies pre-installed.

### Using VS Code Dev Containers

The easiest way to use the development container is through VS Code:

1. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open the Reelay repository in VS Code
3. Press `F1` and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

The container will automatically build and configure the development environment.
